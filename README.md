# Portfolio

## The Project:

### The goal of this project:
This project aims to create a portfolio website that will showcase my projects and skills. The website will be responsive and will be optimized for different screen sizes.

### The website will include:
* A navigation bar
* A section that will contain a short description of myself and my skills
* A section with my projects
  * Each project will have a page containing a title, a description, a link to the project and a link to the GitHub repository
* A section that will contain a contact form
  * The section will contain a form that will allow the user to send me an email
* A footer

### The website will be created using the following:
* HTML
* Tailwindcss
* React
* Next.js
* TypeScript

Note: Normally, I would build a static site, but I want to use my portfolio as an opportunity to learn Next.js and TypeScript.

* Tools:
  * VS Code
  * Figma

### The website will be hosted on:
* Netlify
